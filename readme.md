I spent a lot more time on this than I should have. I got the output almost perfect... I could not figure out how to validate numeric input on my own though. If I entered a letter or a float into a ConsoleReadLine that was expecting an int then it would flip out. However, I did manage to get all of the string input to validate correctly.

As for the code itself, it is definitely sloppy in some spots. There are quite a few areas where I could have spent a bit more time to make a new method instead of copy-pasting code, but I've spent more than a reasonable amount of time on this program already and I just need to be done with it. I'm sure there are many critiques to be made, but I hope it shows just how much effort I put into this.

On a side note, an assignment like this is the exact reason why I desire a screenshot of what our expected output should be. If I'm not given constraints I tend to go overboard without meaning to. I try to do too much and then the next thing I know I'm 14 hours into an assignment that probably only should have been 3 or 4. If I have output to aim for it is much easier for me to determine how hard I need to go at it.
